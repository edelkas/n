<p>The N community was born in <b>2004</b>, and has since developed and extensive amount of content, which has often been scattered in the forums and lost to time, much of it is irrecoverable.
This content includes tools (for highscoring, mapping, fangames, webtools, and others), webpages (forums, chats, wikis, etc), documents (spreadsheets, graphs, mappacks, lists, etc)...</p>
<p>I'm <b>Eddy</b>, I've been a part of this community since 2007 and I've been accumulating resources ever since. At one point I realized my N folder had grown to be historically significant and contained many lost files. So I set up this page with a triple objective in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>As a one stop to find any resource, even when you already know them.</li>
<li>For people to find resources they didn't know about.</li>
<li>For historical preservation.</li>
</ul>
To browse all of these resources, please visit the categories in the side menu. A selection of the most relevant ones is provided in the <a href="index.html">Home</a>.
