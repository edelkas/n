create ruby program to easily create and edit the html table
extensively search the forums, the irc.mountai.net, sidke resources, the old forums, and others, in search of resources
in particular, search for that forums thread which accumulated plenty of fan software
also sidke's wonderful NUMA thread
maybe add section for known resources which were lost (e.g. found in the old forums), asking people that if they have them, send them
