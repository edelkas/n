          <br>




          The previous tutorials dealt with the collision system used in N; while this is by far the largest and most complex part of the game's code, there are various other little systems that some people have asked about, so in this tutorial we'll try to briefly explain some of these other parts.<br>

          <br>




          <br>




          <br>




          Each game object (enemies and other objects) was implemented separately; they were implemented as FSMs <font color="#990000">++TODO: refer to the ai depot FSM/quake tutorial</font>. Most objects were 150-300 lines of code. <br>




          <br>




          The objects were essentially a collection of functions which were called whenever a particular event occurred. For instance, obj.Update() was called whenever the simulation was ticked. <br>




          <br>




          Objects registered themselves for event notification with the object-manager, which notified them whenever needed. <br>




          <br>




          The AI/object system used in N is fairly simple; each object in N can support several "interfaces" (they aren't explicit interfaces in the AS2.0/java sense, however they were treated as such) <br>




          <br>




          There were four main tasks/event-types the object-manager took care of: <br>




          <br>




          <br>




          <br>




          <strong>(A) collision/spatial database</strong><br>




          <ul>




            As described in the previous tutorial, we used a loose grid as a spatial database. <br>




            Any objects which wanted to be notified of collision:<br>




            <ul>




              . must call objectmanager.AddToGrid() and .RemoveFromGrid(); this is equivalent to registering as a listener for a "collision" event<br>




              . must have a .pos<br>




              . must call objectmanager.Moved() whenever the position changes; this lets the objectmanager update the loose grid if necessary<br>




              . must provide .TestVsPlayer(), which returns true if the player is colliding with the object, and false otherwise.




            </ul>




          </ul>




          <br>




          <br>




          <br>




          <br>




          <strong>(B) object updating/sleeping</strong><br>




          <ul>




            Some objects need to be updated each time we tick the simulation; examples are objects which are moving (they need to change their position each tick) or doing anything else constantly (such as targeting the player, or searching for the player). objects can call objectmanager.StartUpdate() and .EndUpdate() to alert the object manager that they should/shouldn't be notified when a simulation tick happens. <br>




            <br>




            This mechanism was the way in which object logic was implemented in the FSM; to change "states", the object simply plugged the appropriate state-specific update function into its generic ".Update" slot. for instance: <br>




            <br>




            <br>




            <br>




            <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">




            <ul>

              function Mover()<br>




              {<br>




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this.Update = null;<br>




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this.MoveLeft();<br>




              }<br>




              <br>




              <br>




              //----- state-changing events -----<br>




              Mover.prototype.MoveLeft()<br>




              {<br>




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this.Update = this.Update_MoveLeft;<br>




              }<br>




              <br>




              <br>




              //----- state-changing events -----<br>




              Mover.prototype.MoveRight()<br>




              {<br>




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this.Update = this.Update_MoveRight;<br>




              }<br>

              {<br>




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//move to the left<br>




              }<br>




              <br>




              <br>




              Mover.prototype.Update_MoveRight<br>




              {<br>




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//move to the right<br>




              }<br>




            </ul>




            </font> <br>




            <br>




            <br>




            <br>




            The article cited above provides many ideas about how to improve and extend this simple implementation; also, many of the "game programming gems" books contain articles on FSMs. <br>




            <br>




            Since updating objects takes time, it's advantageous to only update those objects which need to be updated. For instance, some objects (such as doors) only need to be updated while the player is near them; most of the time they're inert, and don't require updating. using the StartUpdate/EndUpdate mechanism, objects were able to "sleep" in between periods of activity by simply unplugging themselves from the update event when they were done "doing stuff".




          </ul>




          <br>




          <br>




          <br>




          <br>




          <strong>(C) drawing</strong> <br>




          <ul>




            Since the simulation is run at a constant 40Hz, but the rendering is done at a different rate (depending on the client's machine), by uncoupling Update() from Draw(), we can save some time -- objects only need to update their graphical information (i.e. the ._x and ._y position of their gfx MC, etc.) when the Draw event occurs. similar to Update, in this way objects which don't move don't need to keep touching their MCs, which saves time.




          </ul>




          <br>




          <br>




          <br>




          <br>




          <strong>(D) visibility queries/AI updates</strong><br>




          <ul>




            Casting rays through the world is a fairly costly process. in order to maintain a fast framerate, we implemented "staggered" AI updates; any object which requires costly updates (such as raycasts for visibility) can subscribe to the Think event. Each time the simulation is ticked, SOME of the objects are allowed to Think(); this way, the cost of the raycasts/etc. is spread over several frames. The tradeoff is that objects don't respond instantly; there are a few frames between a change in visibility (i.e. the ninja becoming visible to an enemy) and the corresponding change in logic (the enemy being aware of the change in visibility). However, since the game is ticked at 40hz, a delay of even 10 ticks is short enough to not make a substantial difference.

          <br>




          <br>




          The player/ninja object is a game object like any other enemy or item, however the logic controlling the player is far more complex. instead of a single FSM, the player's logic is implemented as two FSMs; one controls the player's high-level state (i.e. "alive" or "dead"); the other controls the player's low-level state (i.e. running, jumping, etc.). <br>




          <br>




          The method of implementation of the player's FSM is relatively crude; instead of explicitly creating an FSM system by defining FSM_State objects, etc., we simply use a loose collection of the "insides" of those states. <br>




          <br>




          Instead of a hash table defining state transitions (i.e. given the current state and an event type, the hash table would return the next state the player should be in), we used hardcoded logic in a series of nested conditional branches. <br>




          <br>




          This approach was taken not for performance reasons, but because work on a previous game taught us that over-engineering the player logic, while perhaps beneficial in more complex games (for instance fighting games, where character behaviours are very complex and should be modular to allow vast changes), just makes the task of implementing the player logic more complex, time-consuming, and bug-prone when the range of player behaviours is relatively small and simple. <br>




          <br>




          The two main states of the player are "alive" and "dead". while alive, the player is controlled by an FSM which contains all of the player's behaviour states, such as: <br>




          <ul>




            . standing<br>




            . falling<br>




            . jumping<br>




            . wallsliding




          </ul>




          <br>




          This FSM takes as input various events; user input (keypresses), collision input, etc. <br>




          <br>




          Instead of implementing such events explicitly, they're mostly implemented as a set of flags indicating various things about the player's status; for instance, if the player is near a wall, or on the ground. The player's logic can look at these flags and respond accordingly. <br>




          <br>




          The player is modeled as a circle for collision vs. the world; the direction of the projection vector returned by our collision system lets us infer the angle of the surface the player is currently on, and rotate the player's graphics accordingly. <br>




          <br>




          While "dead", the player is controlled by a physics simulation which is a straightforward implementation of this paper: <font color="#990000">++TODO: refer to jakobsen</font> <br>




          <br>




          The ragdoll model used is 6 particles (shoulders, pelvis, hand x2, foot x2) connected by 5 "stick" constraints (torso, arms, legs). Instead of having a single length, the sticks have minimum and maximum lengths; if their current length falls outside of this range, it is forced into the allowed range (as explained in Jakobsen's paper). <br>




          <br>




          The way that the ragdoll is rendered is very flash-specific, so we won't describe it in detail (look at the provided source, it's fairly simple). However, the general idea (which can be applied in any rendering environment) is that the position of the "midpoints" of each limb (elbows, knees, etc.) are implicitly defined by: <br>




          <ul>




            . the position of the limb endpoints <br>




            . the distance between the limb endpoints




          </ul>




          <br>




          <font color="#990000">++TODO: animated diagram of a single limb, with triangle-relationship depicted</font> <br>




          <br>




          The limb is a triangle abc, where a is the root of the limb (for instance, the shoulder), b is the midpoint (for instance, the elbow), and c is the end of the limb (for instance, the hand). We know the position of a and c, and can calculate the length of a->c. We also know the length of a->b and b->c since these never change. <br>




          <br>




          We collide this ragdoll model by colliding 6 small AABBs, located at the same positions as the ragdoll particles. because these AABBs are so small, and can move rather fast, we use multisampling to reduce the error of the collision results. We also use some bounce and friction to make the ragdoll behave in a somewhat cartoonish manner during collision. <br>

          -- &nbsp;&nbsp;-constant rate simulation (explanation and example code) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-deterministic replays: store key states at each tick &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-clients query keystates -refer to online material (gdalgorithms, but there's another source too..) -- <br>




          <br>




          <br>




          <br>




          NOTE: we might want to start with this section (i.e. it should maybe be section 1) <br>




          <br>




          The main game "loop" in N updates the simulation at a constant rate, and then draws the current state of the world. The decision to use a constant-rate system was made because our chosen method of physics simulation couldn't easily be adapted to deal with variable-rate updates. <br>




          <br>




          However, the constant-rate update allowed us to create a perfectly deterministic simulation, which is much harder (or perhaps not possible) using a "delta-time"-type update. this determinism allowed us to easily implement "replays". <br>




          <br>




          Each time we update the simulation, we store the current state of the keys. (in N, 3 keys were used: "left", "right", and "jump"). The game logic doesn't refer directly to the key states, but instead queries an input-handler for the keystates; this means that we can simply use an input-handler which uses prerecorded keystates (instead of the current keyboard data) in order to implement a replay system. <br>




          <br>




          <font color="#990000">++TODO: refer to gamasutra replay article and any other articles</font> <br>




          <br>




          None of the game code other than the input-handler cares at all whether the current simulation is driven by real-time or prerecorded keyboard input. <br>




          <br>




          The main problem with this system is that we can't use the built-in quasi-random number generator Math.random(), because (for some unknown and probably silly reason) we don't have access to the "seed" value used, and thus can't reproduce the values deterministically. For purely aesthetic things, which have no effect on the simulation at all (for instance, particle effects) we use the built-in random function. For everything else, we use a very simple method: we query the current game time, and % it with the range of values we want. <br>




          <br>




          For instance, (gameTime % 10) will give us a deterministic value between 0 and 9, which will seem random to the user. <br>




          <br>




          Of course, this type of "randomness" is in fact not random at all; we found that it was sufficient for our needs, and certainly much cheaper to calculate than any other method we could find. If you really need reproducible randomness, you could implement a proper quasi-random number generator. <br>

          <br>




          <strong>--= normalization =--</strong> <br>






          <br>




          Normalizing a vector is simply scaling it so that its length is 1.<br>




          <strong>Unit-length</strong> vectors are useful for many things, such as representing directions.<br>




          <br>




          To normalize the vector <strong>v</strong>, we simply divide each of its components by the length of <strong>v</strong>: <br>




          <br>




          <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">len_v = Math.sqrt(v.x*v.x + v.y*v.y);<br>




          v.x /= len_v;<br>




          v.y /= len_v; </font><br>




          <br>




          Note that unless you can <strong>guarantee</strong> that <strong>v</strong> isn't a null (0-length) vector, you might want to add tests which detect this case, or the dreaded <strong>division-by-0</strong> will occur. <br>




          <br>




          <br>




          <br>




          <strong>--= dot product =--</strong> <br>




          <br>




          the dot product of two vectors <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong> is given by: <br>




          <br>




          <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">dp = a.x*b.x + a.y*b.y;</font> <br>




          <br>




          Note that the result is a scalar value (a single number). <br>




          You can think of it as describing the relative orientation of <strong>a</strong></strong> and <strong>b</strong>; a negative dot product means that <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong> point away from each other; a positive dot product means they point in the same direction. <br>




          <br>




          However, since the magnitude of the dot product is determined by the lengths of <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong>, only the <strong>sign</strong> (positive/negative) of the dot product is directly useful without further manipulation. <br>




          <br>




          <br>




          <br>




          <strong>--= projection =--</strong> <br>




          <br>




          The formula for projecting vector <strong>a</strong> onto vector <strong>b</strong> is: <br>




          <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><br>




          proj.x = ( dp / (b.x*b.x + b.y*b.y) ) * b.x;<br>




          proj.y = ( dp / (b.x*b.x + b.y*b.y) ) * b.y;</font><br>




          <br>




          where dp is the dotprod of <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong>: <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">dp = (a.x*b.x + a.y*b.y)</font><br>




          <br>




          Note that the result is a vector; also, <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">(b.x*b.x + b.y*b.y)</font> is simply the length of <strong>b</strong> squared. <br>




          <br>




          If <strong>b</strong> is a unit vector, <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">(b.x*b.x + b.y*b.y) = 1</font>, and thus <strong>a</strong> projected onto <strong>b</strong> reduces to: <br>




          <br>




          <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"> proj.x = dp*b.x;<br>




          proj.y = dp*b.y;</font> <br>

          <strong>--= perproduct =--</strong> <br>




          <br>




          Another useful concept in 2D geometry is the "normal"...not to be confused with normalization! <br>




          <br>




          Basically, the normal of a line is simply the direction which is <strong>perpendicular</strong> to it. <br>




          <br>




          Every 2D vector has two such normals: the <strong>right hand</strong> and <strong>left hand</strong> normal. As you might expect, the right hand normal points to the <strong>right</strong> of the vector, and the left hand normal points to the <strong>left</strong>. <br>




          <br>




          Given a vector <strong>a</strong>, the right hand normal of <strong>a</strong> is simply: <br>




          <br>




          <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">rn.x = -a.y;<br>




          rn.y = a.x;</font> <br>




          <br>




          and the left hand normal is: <br>




          <br>




          <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">ln.x = a.y;<br>




          ln.y = -a.x; </font><br>




          <br>




          Note that <strong>ln</strong> = -<strong>rn</strong>. <br>




          <br>




          The perproduct of two vectors <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong> is simply the dot product of <strong>a</strong> and the right hand normal of <strong>b</strong>. <br>
