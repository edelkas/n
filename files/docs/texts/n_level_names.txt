The Legend of N Level Names

Wacky, informative, hilarious, thought-provoking, bizarre and just plain weird level names are a long-standing tradition in the N universe. It began in the early days of 2004, when production on the first N levels was drawing to a close. It started with Mare and Raigan trying to make each other laugh, and just sort of blossomed from there.

Level names are an opportunity to lovingly reference our favourite games, tv shows, movies, people, books, artwork, animals and phrases, and allow us to geek out and really embrace our love of bad puns, nerdy subject matter, helpful gameplay tips, and general personality. That's our gift to you.

For Metanet Software, naming levels in games is also an easy and fun way to keep things interesting. When you're making and repeatedly testing hundreds of levels often under severe time restrictions, you need something to keep yourself sane. Have we succeeded? You be the judge -- the complete list of N and N+ level names to date can be found starting at about the middle of this page. Enjoy! :)

Level Names

SUBLiME

Because we love our fans so much, we decided to hold a contest for N v1.4 in which submitted levels would be considered for inclusion in N. The successful submissions comprise the 80s column in N. This contest was the precursor to N+'s the SUBLiME.

N+ features a ton of fan-made content provided by fans of the original game, N. We held a contest-like event in summer 2007, called SUBLiME, in which fans were invited to submit their best levels which we would then play and include the best of in N+. Fans of N got to try their hand at wacky level naming, too! Read more about SUBLiME here.

Contesque 1

July 23, 2008 saw the release of PDLC0, the first N+ level pack. For 200 points, this pack features 150 easier single player levels and 50 coop multiplayer. Read more about the N+ DLC here.

We held a Contesque to celebrate the launch of the level pack, which you can read more about here. This contesque was all about level names. After explaining which level names would never appear in N+ XBLA PDLC0, we showed a little insight into the etymology of 24 XBLA level names:

Contesque 1: Level Names
The Fakes are highlighted in Red:


01. west enderson

A combination of "west end" and "wes anderson"; west end is a popular end of London, England, and Wes Anderson is a fantastic director of great movies. Also players move through the level from east to west / left to right.

02. tread on my dreams

The tread series of N+ levels includes "I'd rather be tread", among others; the basic idea is to copy or evoke a phrase which uses the word tread, or a word that rhymes with tread. Levels in the tread series visually resemble tire treads.

03. the hammer of not bickering

A quote from the movie "Mystery Men" which we at Metanet find funny. There are a lot of good lines in that movie: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0132347/quotes

04. blue mineys

A reference to the blue meanies from the Beatles' Yellow Submarine movie (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Meanies_%28Yellow_Submarine%29), and also refers to the way that, in the level, zap drones (which are blue) are fulfilling the function that mines tend to.

05. the grayzor mountains

A reference to one of Metanet's favourite Penny Arcade comics, featuring Mr. Period: http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/11/03/. Hilarious! The level also features mountain shapes, and is, of course, gray.

06. out of the blue 3

Preceeded by 'out of the blue 1 and 2', this series features zap drones hidden behind bounceblocks, which appear from out of the blue -- well, sort of. Also, they're blue, so it's sort of like the blue out of something... anyway, it made sense at the time.

07. your ninja is in another castle

A classic phrase referencing one of everyone's favourite games, Super Mario Bros. for the NES.

08. ranks a rot

A possibly-Scooby-Doo-related phrase which has recently grown in popularity but which is pretty dumb, unfunny, and just plain not good enough. It won't get past the quality control filters here at Metanet!

09. I am comin’ to kill ya

A quote from Simpsons episode 9F22, Cape Feare: http://www.twiztv.com/scripts/simpsons/season5/thesimpsons-502.htm "slowly and painfully" -- though for the ninja, it's more like quickly and painfully ;)

10. sudden valley

A reference to Arrested Development, one of both Mare and Raigan's favourite TV series'. "Salad dressing. But I don't really want to eat it." http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367279/quotes It is also a reference to the level's tileset.

11. supercalifragilisticexpialidoc-N

Though we are fond of emphasizing the N in level names, such as "N-diana Jones", "brain N-eurysm" and "obsessio-N", we don't throw in "N" where it doesn't belong. Plus, this level name would have been preposterously long!

12. the hills are, uh, live

A reference to "The Sound of Music", mainly based on the commonly-known phrase "The Hills Are Alive", rather than a fondness for the source. The level features electric gates placed on top of the level's tiles, which are arranged so as to evoke hills. Hence, they're "live" in an electrical sense.

13. 88 gates

A reference to Queasy Game "Gate 88", which is awesome. This level features a whole bunch of electric gates.

14. billesque

Newsradio (a great TV series) reference: http://evilzero.com/NewsRadio/dave.htm. One of a series also including "billilicious" and "billbastic".

15. N-KOTB

Metanet doesn't like NKOTB, not now, and not when either party was in grade 5 or whenever the group debuted. Of course, if you didn't magically know that, you were pretty well screwed with this one as there are no other hints.

16. ninja’s first suicidal lust for gold

A level in a series of "ninja's firsts" which includes "walljump", "descent" and "set of safety pits". These levels tend to introduce a concept to the player.

17. superliminal monument

The superliminal series is long standing, extending to the very first versions of N. The tiles in this series reference N, N+ and the Metanet logo very obviously, hence "super-"liminal rather than "sub-".

18. what are we doing to pigs?

A one-off from "The Daily Show", a TV show we at Metanet enjoy a good deal. This segment had a completely amazing, very memorable themesong. This level features an approximation of a pig's silhouette from the logo for the McPork, which we saw in Japan at TGS last year. So funny.

19. subliminal 2

There is a series of the "super-"liminial, but never "sub-". We're just not that subtle here at Metanet ;)

20. little lost robot

a reference to an Isaac Asimov short story. His work is fondly re-read every few years around here. This level features a tileset illustrating a robotic face.

21. level in the shape of male reproductive organs

Too controversial, would never pass the censors. Funny thing is, we did name a level this, just for fun, but thought the better of it before officially submitting. That level is now called "anatomy of a level".

22. ninja: impossible

One of two suggested "better" titles for N+ by a player on the Xbox forums. The other was "ninja school". We thought they deserved mention :)

23. Droids ‘B’ Us

A reference to the classic game Space Quest 1. Such a good game, although we hated the frequent, instant deaths -- is that irony?

24. the new star wars trilogy is AWESOME

No, it's not.

25. ocho!

A popular catchphrase around Metanet's office, for no real reason. Or many. It's hard to tell sometimes.

26. "going next door"

A reference to "Spaced", a British TV series we thought was great fun, and very well written. http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Spaced In the series, it is a euphemism for death, which is of course very appropriate for N+.

27. his name is N

A popular misconception. No, it's not. The ninja is without gender, and N refers to "the way of the ninja", not to the ninja.

28. gauss darn it

A "hilarious" pun ("gosh" darn it). This level features a gauss turret, hence the name. We like puns!

29. Level 5, Detention Block AA-23

A "Star Wars" reference, but not to one of those new prequel crap-fests -- a reference to the classic, original series, or as it is also known, the only series that really exists.

30. the grass is always grayer on the other side

Wordplay based on the common phrase "the grass is always greener on the other side" -- we replace colours in common phrases with "gray" a lot, as in "somewhere over the graynbow", "all the leaves are gray, and the sky is gray", and many more.

31. life support, for real this time

Life Support is a level from the N+ original Co-Op levels we intended to be a lot harder than it is -- clever players found shortcuts. We challenge you to find them in this one!

32. electric jellyfish

A level from the built-in levels in N+. So this was sort of a trick -- it won't appear in N+ PDLC0 because it has already been used. Gotcha!

\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contesque 2

September 10, 2008 saw the release of PDLC1, the second N+ level pack. For 200 points, this pack features 150 harder single player levels, 50 race multiplayer and 25 survival multiplayer levels. Read more about the N+ DLC here.

We held a Contesque to celebrate the launch of this level pack as well, which you can read more about here. This contesque was all about the references in level names, or really about the references which are not in level names found in Level Pack #2. These contesques are quite silly, but provide a little insight into how we at Metanet spend our time when we're not working. Here are the level names we did and did not reference:
